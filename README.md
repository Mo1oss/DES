\# DES Implementation in Python



This project implements the Data Encryption Standard (DES) in pure Python.

It includes:

\- Key schedule (PC1, PC2, SHIFTS)

\- Initial and Final permutations (IP, FP)

\- Feistel rounds with S-boxes and P permutation

\- A built-in self-test using a known DES test vector.



\## How to Run



```bash

python des.py
